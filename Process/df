       signal - overview of signals

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Linux supports both POSIX reliable signals (hereinafter "standard signals") and POSIX real-time signals.

   SSiiggnnaall ddiissppoossiittiioonnss
       Each  signal has a current _d_i_s_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n, which determines how the process behaves when it is delivered the sig‐
       nal.

       The entries in the "Action" column of the table below specify the default disposition for each signal, as fol‐
       lows:

       Term   Default action is to terminate the process.

       Ign    Default action is to ignore the signal.

       Core   Default action is to terminate the process and dump core (see ccoorree(5)).

       Stop   Default action is to stop the process.

       Cont   Default action is to continue the process if it is currently stopped.

       A  process can change the disposition of a signal using ssiiggaaccttiioonn(2) or ssiiggnnaall(2).  (The latter is less porta‐
       ble when establishing a signal handler; see ssiiggnnaall(2) for details.)  Using these system calls, a  process  can
       elect  one  of  the following behaviors to occur on delivery of the signal: perform the default action; ignore
       the signal; or catch the signal with a _s_i_g_n_a_l _h_a_n_d_l_e_r, a programmer-defined function that is automatically in‐
       voked when the signal is delivered.

       By  default, a signal handler is invoked on the normal process stack.  It is possible to arrange that the sig‐
       nal handler uses an alternate stack; see ssiiggaallttssttaacckk(2) for a discussion of how to do this and when  it  might
       be useful.

       The  signal  disposition is a per-process attribute: in a multithreaded application, the disposition of a par‐
       ticular signal is the same for all threads.

       A child created via ffoorrkk(2) inherits a copy of its parent's signal dispositions.   During  an  eexxeeccvvee(2),  the
       dispositions  of  handled  signals  are reset to the default; the dispositions of ignored signals are left un‐
       changed.

   SSeennddiinngg aa ssiiggnnaall
       The following system calls and library functions allow the caller to send a signal:

       rraaiissee(3)        Sends a signal to the calling thread.

       kkiillll(2)         Sends a signal to a specified process, to all members of a specified process group, or to  all
                       processes on the system.

       kkiillllppgg(3)       Sends a signal to all of the members of a specified process group.

       pptthhrreeaadd__kkiillll(3) Sends a signal to a specified POSIX thread in the same process as the caller.

       ttggkkiillll(2)       Sends a signal to a specified thread within a specific process.  (This is the system call used
                       to implement pptthhrreeaadd__kkiillll(3).)

       ssiiggqquueeuuee(3)     Sends a real-time signal with accompanying data to a specified process.

   WWaaiittiinngg ffoorr aa ssiiggnnaall ttoo bbee ccaauugghhtt
       The following system calls suspend execution of the calling thread until a signal is caught (or  an  unhandled
       signal terminates the process):

       ppaauussee(2)        Suspends execution until any signal is caught.

       ssiiggssuussppeenndd(2)   Temporarily  changes  the  signal mask (see below) and suspends execution until one of the un‐
                       masked signals is caught.

   SSyynncchhrroonnoouussllyy aacccceeppttiinngg aa ssiiggnnaall
       Rather than asynchronously catching a signal via a signal handler, it is possible to synchronously accept  the
       signal,  that is, to block execution until the signal is delivered, at which point the kernel returns informa‐
       tion about the signal to the caller.  There are two general ways to do this:

       * ssiiggwwaaiittiinnffoo(2), ssiiggttiimmeeddwwaaiitt(2), and ssiiggwwaaiitt(3) suspend execution until one of the signals  in  a  specified
         set is delivered.  Each of these calls returns information about the delivered signal.

       * ssiiggnnaallffdd(2)  returns a file descriptor that can be used to read information about signals that are delivered
         to the caller.  Each rreeaadd(2) from this file descriptor blocks until one of the signals in the set  specified
         in the ssiiggnnaallffdd(2) call is delivered to the caller.  The buffer returned by rreeaadd(2) contains a structure de‐
         scribing the signal.

   SSiiggnnaall mmaasskk aanndd ppeennddiinngg ssiiggnnaallss
       A signal may be _b_l_o_c_k_e_d, which means that it will not be delivered until it is later unblocked.   Between  the
       time when it is generated and when it is delivered a signal is said to be _p_e_n_d_i_n_g.

       Each thread in a process has an independent _s_i_g_n_a_l _m_a_s_k, which indicates the set of signals that the thread is
       currently blocking.  A thread can manipulate its signal mask using pptthhrreeaadd__ssiiggmmaasskk(3).  In a traditional  sin‐
       gle-threaded application, ssiiggpprrooccmmaasskk(2) can be used to manipulate the signal mask.

       A  child  created via ffoorrkk(2) inherits a copy of its parent's signal mask; the signal mask is preserved across
       eexxeeccvvee(2).

       A signal may be process-directed or thread-directed.  A process-directed signal is one  that  is  targeted  at
       (and  thus  pending for) the process as a whole.  A signal may be process-directed because it was generated by
       the kernel for reasons other than a hardware exception, or because it was sent using kkiillll(2)  or  ssiiggqquueeuuee(3).
       A  thread-directed  signal  is one that is targeted at a specific thread.  A signal may be thread-directed be‐
       cause it was generated as a consequence of executing a specific machine-language instruction that triggered  a
       hardware exception (e.g., SSIIGGSSEEGGVV for an invalid memory access, or SSIIGGFFPPEE for a math error), or because it was
       targeted at a specific thread using interfaces such as ttggkkiillll(2) or pptthhrreeaadd__kkiillll(3).

       A process-directed signal may be delivered to any one of the threads that does not currently have  the  signal
       blocked.   If  more  than  one  of  the threads has the signal unblocked, then the kernel chooses an arbitrary
       thread to which to deliver the signal.

       A thread can obtain the set of signals that it currently has pending using ssiiggppeennddiinngg(2).  This set will  con‐
       sist  of the union of the set of pending process-directed signals and the set of signals pending for the call‐
       ing thread.

       A child created via ffoorrkk(2) initially has an empty pending signal set; the pending  signal  set  is  preserved
       across an eexxeeccvvee(2).

       Linux supports the standard signals listed below.  The second column of the table indicates which standard (if
       any) specified the signal: "P1990" indicates that the signal is described in the original  POSIX.1-1990  stan‐
       dard; "P2001" indicates that the signal was added in SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001.

       The signals SSIIGGKKIILLLL and SSIIGGSSTTOOPP cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

       Up  to and including Linux 2.2, the default behavior for SSIIGGSSYYSS, SSIIGGXXCCPPUU, SSIIGGXXFFSSZZ, and (on architectures other
       than SPARC and MIPS) SSIIGGBBUUSS was to terminate the process (without a core dump).  (On some other  UNIX  systems
       the  default  action for SSIIGGXXCCPPUU and SSIIGGXXFFSSZZ is to terminate the process without a core dump.)  Linux 2.4 con‐
       forms to the POSIX.1-2001 requirements for these signals, terminating the process with a core dump.

       SSIIGGEEMMTT is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, but nevertheless appears on most other UNIX systems,  where  its  de‐
       fault action is typically to terminate the process with a core dump.

       SSIIGGPPWWRR  (which  is  not specified in POSIX.1-2001) is typically ignored by default on those other UNIX systems
       where it appears.

       SSIIGGIIOO (which is not specified in POSIX.1-2001) is ignored by default on several other UNIX systems.

       If multiple standard signals are pending for a process, the order in which the signals are  delivered  is  un‐
       specified.

       Standard  signals do not queue.  If multiple instances of a standard signal are generated while that signal is
       blocked, then only one instance of the signal is marked as pending (and the signal will be delivered just once
       when  it  is unblocked).  In the case where a standard signal is already pending, the _s_i_g_i_n_f_o___t structure (see
       ssiiggaaccttiioonn(2)) associated with that signal is not overwritten on arrival of subsequent instances  of  the  same
       signal.  Thus, the process will receive the information associated with the first instance of the signal.

       The  numeric value for each signal is given in the table below.  As shown in the table, many signals have dif‐
       ferent numeric values on different architectures.  The first numeric value in each table row shows the  signal
       number  on  x86,  ARM, and most other architectures; the second value is for Alpha and SPARC; the third is for
       MIPS; and the last is for PARISC.  A dash (-) denotes that a signal is absent on the  corresponding  architec‐
       ture.

       Starting with version 2.2, Linux supports real-time signals as originally defined in  the  POSIX.1b  real-time
       extensions  (and  now  included  in POSIX.1-2001).  The range of supported real-time signals is defined by the
       macros SSIIGGRRTTMMIINN and SSIIGGRRTTMMAAXX.  POSIX.1-2001 requires that an implementation support at least  __PPOOSSIIXX__RRTTSSIIGG__MMAAXX
       (8) real-time signals.

       The  Linux  kernel  supports a range of 33 different real-time signals, numbered 32 to 64.  However, the glibc
       POSIX threads implementation internally uses two (for NPTL) or three (for LinuxThreads) real-time signals (see
       pptthhrreeaaddss(7)),  and adjusts the value of SSIIGGRRTTMMIINN suitably (to 34 or 35).  Because the range of available real-
       time signals varies according to the glibc threading implementation (and this variation can occur at run  time
       according  to  the  available  kernel and glibc), and indeed the range of real-time signals varies across UNIX
       systems, programs should _n_e_v_e_r _r_e_f_e_r _t_o _r_e_a_l_-_t_i_m_e _s_i_g_n_a_l_s _u_s_i_n_g _h_a_r_d_-_c_o_d_e_d _n_u_m_b_e_r_s, but instead should  always
       refer  to  real-time signals using the notation SSIIGGRRTTMMIINN+n, and include suitable (run-time) checks that SSIIGGRRTT‐‐
       MMIINN+n does not exceed SSIIGGRRTTMMAAXX.

       Unlike standard signals, real-time signals have no predefined meanings: the entire set  of  real-time  signals
       can be used for application-defined purposes.

       The default action for an unhandled real-time signal is to terminate the receiving process.

       Real-time signals are distinguished by the following:

       1.  Multiple  instances  of real-time signals can be queued.  By contrast, if multiple instances of a standard
           signal are delivered while that signal is currently blocked, then only one instance is queued.

       2.  If the signal is sent using ssiiggqquueeuuee(3), an accompanying value (either an integer or  a  pointer)  can  be
           sent with the signal.  If the receiving process establishes a handler for this signal using the SSAA__SSIIGGIINNFFOO
           flag to ssiiggaaccttiioonn(2), then it can obtain this data via the  _s_i___v_a_l_u_e  field  of  the  _s_i_g_i_n_f_o___t  structure
           passed as the second argument to the handler.  Furthermore, the _s_i___p_i_d and _s_i___u_i_d fields of this structure
           can be used to obtain the PID and real user ID of the process sending the signal.

       3.  Real-time signals are delivered in a guaranteed order.  Multiple real-time signals of the  same  type  are
           delivered in the order they were sent.  If different real-time signals are sent to a process, they are de‐
           livered starting with the lowest-numbered signal.  (I.e., low-numbered signals have highest priority.)  By
           contrast, if multiple standard signals are pending for a process, the order in which they are delivered is
           unspecified.

       If both standard and real-time signals are pending for a process, POSIX leaves it unspecified which is  deliv‐
       ered first.  Linux, like many other implementations, gives priority to standard signals in this case.

       According  to POSIX, an implementation should permit at least __PPOOSSIIXX__SSIIGGQQUUEEUUEE__MMAAXX (32) real-time signals to be
       queued to a process.  However, Linux does things differently.  In kernels up to and including 2.6.7, Linux im‐
       poses  a  system-wide  limit  on  the number of queued real-time signals for all processes.  This limit can be
       viewed and (with privilege) changed via the _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_k_e_r_n_e_l_/_r_t_s_i_g_-_m_a_x file.  A related  file,  _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_k_e_r_‐
       _n_e_l_/_r_t_s_i_g_-_n_r,  can be used to find out how many real-time signals are currently queued.  In Linux 2.6.8, these
       _/_p_r_o_c interfaces were replaced by the RRLLIIMMIITT__SSIIGGPPEENNDDIINNGG resource limit, which specifies a per-user  limit  for
       queued signals; see sseettrrlliimmiitt(2) for further details.

       The  addition  of real-time signals required the widening of the signal set structure (_s_i_g_s_e_t___t) from 32 to 64
       bits.  Consequently, various system calls were superseded by new system calls that supported the larger signal
       sets.  The old and new system calls are as follows:

       If a signal handler is invoked while a system call or library function call is blocked, then either:

       * the call is automatically restarted after the signal handler returns; or

       * the call fails with the error EEIINNTTRR.

       Which  of these two behaviors occurs depends on the interface and whether or not the signal handler was estab‐
       lished using the SSAA__RREESSTTAARRTT flag (see ssiiggaaccttiioonn(2)).  The details vary across UNIX systems; below, the details
       for Linux.

       If  a blocked call to one of the following interfaces is interrupted by a signal handler, then the call is au‐
       tomatically restarted after the signal handler returns if the SSAA__RREESSTTAARRTT flag was  used;  otherwise  the  call
       fails with the error EEIINNTTRR:

       * rreeaadd(2),  rreeaaddvv(2), wwrriittee(2), wwrriitteevv(2), and iiooccttll(2) calls on "slow" devices.  A "slow" device is one where
         the I/O call may block for an indefinite time, for example, a terminal, pipe, or socket.  If an I/O call  on
         a  slow device has already transferred some data by the time it is interrupted by a signal handler, then the
         call will return a success status (normally, the number of bytes transferred).  Note that a (local) disk  is
         not  a  slow device according to this definition; I/O operations on disk devices are not interrupted by sig‐
         nals.

       * ooppeenn(2), if it can block (e.g., when opening a FIFO; see ffiiffoo(7)).

         and sseennddmmssgg(2), unless a timeout has been set on the socket (see below).

       * File locking interfaces: fflloocckk(2) and the FF__SSEETTLLKKWW and FF__OOFFDD__SSEETTLLKKWW operations of ffccnnttll(2)

       * POSIX  semaphore interfaces: sseemm__wwaaiitt(3) and sseemm__ttiimmeeddwwaaiitt(3) (since Linux 2.6.22; beforehand, always failed

       The following interfaces are never restarted after being interrupted by a signal handler,  regardless  of  the
       use of SSAA__RREESSTTAARRTT; they always fail with the error EEIINNTTRR when interrupted by a signal handler:

       * "Input"  socket interfaces, when a timeout (SSOO__RRCCVVTTIIMMEEOO) has been set on the socket using sseettssoocckkoopptt(2): aacc‐‐

       The sslleeeepp(3) function is also never restarted if interrupted by a handler, but gives  a  success  return:  the
       number of seconds remaining to sleep.

       On  Linux,  even  in the absence of signal handlers, certain blocking interfaces can fail with the error EEIINNTTRR
       after the process is stopped by one of the stop signals and then resumed via SSIIGGCCOONNTT.  This  behavior  is  not
       sanctioned by POSIX.1, and doesn't occur on other systems.

       The Linux interfaces that display this behavior are:

       * "Input"  socket interfaces, when a timeout (SSOO__RRCCVVTTIIMMEEOO) has been set on the socket using sseettssoocckkoopptt(2): aacc‐‐

       There are six signals that can be delivered as a consequence of a hardware exception: SSIIGGBBUUSS, SSIIGGEEMMTT,  SSIIGGFFPPEE,
       SSIIGGIILLLL,  SSIIGGSSEEGGVV,  and SSIIGGTTRRAAPP.  Which of these signals is delivered, for any given hardware exception, is not
       documented and does not always make sense.

       For example, an invalid memory access that causes delivery of SSIIGGSSEEGGVV on one CPU architecture may cause deliv‐
       ery of SSIIGGBBUUSS on another architecture, or vice versa.

       For  another example, using the x86 _i_n_t instruction with a forbidden argument (any number other than 3 or 128)
       causes delivery of SSIIGGSSEEGGVV, even though SSIIGGIILLLL would make more sense, because of how the CPU reports the  for‐
